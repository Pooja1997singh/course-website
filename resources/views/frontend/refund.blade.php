                            <li>The supply of Goods which according to their nature are not suitable to be returned,
                                deteriorate rapidly or where the date of expiry is over.</li>
                            <li>The supply of Goods which are not suitable for return due to health protection or hygiene

                        <p>We reserve the right to refuse returns of any merchandise that does not meet the above return
                            conditions in our sole discretion.</p>
                        <p>Only regular priced Goods may be refunded. Unfortunately, Goods on sale cannot be refunded. This

                        <h1>Returning Goods</h1>
                        <p>You are responsible for the cost and risk of returning the Goods to Us. You should send the Goods
                            at the following address:</p>
                        <p>C-157, Janak Cinema Community Center Janakpuri<br>

                        <p>We cannot be held responsible for Goods damaged or lost in return shipment. Therefore, We
                            recommend an insured and trackable mail service. We are unable to issue a refund without actual
                            receipt of the Goods or proof of received return delivery.</p>
                        <h1>Gifts</h1>
                        <p>If the Goods were marked as a gift when purchased and then shipped directly to you, You'll
                            receive a gift credit for the value of your return. Once the returned product is received, a
                            gift certificate will be mailed to You.</p>
                        <p>If the Goods weren't marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift giver had the Order shipped to
                            themselves to give it to You later, We will send the refund to the gift giver.</p>
